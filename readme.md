# Universal Credit Addon

This is a chrome extension that adds quality of life features to the universal credit section of the UK government's website. 

## Features

### Insert todays date

When adding a job to your journal, you will be prompted to add the date that you applied for that job. This extension adds a button to insert todays date in the respective fields.

### Export to CSV

At the bottom of the first page for all your logged jobs, you will now see a button that says "Export to CSV". This button will do what it says on the tin, it will grab all your job listings and export it to a CSV. Great for generating information about your job hunting endeavours. 

***Now supports job logging types (applied,interested,interview)***

## How to run

Download the source code and then go to chrome://extensions and then load unpacked. After this pick the GovDateAdder folder. Simple as that.
